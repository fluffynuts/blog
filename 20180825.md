# Random value generation and builders

## Basic random value generation

As part of the series of posts illuminating [PeanutButter](https://github.com/fluffynuts/PeanutButter), one of the topics I wanted to cover was `PeanutButter.RandomValueGen`, a utility I find it difficult to start testing without (and it turns out that it's infected others too, hopefully making writing tests a little less effort).

`RandomValueGen` started life innocuously enough: I wanted random primitive values. We had an in-house nuget package for doing this, but it also included a bunch of other stuff I didn't want and depended on some other assemblies that I didn't need, so I figured it wouldn't be too hard to come up with my own. Personally, I prefer the use of `using static` for clearer (read: shorter) code,
so one might see me use `RandomValueGen` in tests like so:

```csharp
// ... other imports above
using static PeanutButter.RandomValueGen;

namespace Tests
{
  [TestFixture]
  public class TestSomething
  {
    [Test]
    public void ShouldGetSomeRandomValues()
    {
      var someInt = GetRandomInt();
      var someString = GetRandomString();
      var someDate = GetRandomDate();
      var flag = GetRandomBoolean();
      var money = GetRandomDecimal();
      var dbl = GetRandomDouble();
      // ... proceed with the rest of the test
    }
  }
}
```

Pretty-much all the primatives you'd expect are there, but there are some others which are more tailored to specific situations
```csharp
[Test]
public void MoreRandoms()
{
    var email = GetRandomEmail();
    var url = GetRandomHttpUrl();
    var alpha = GetRandomAlphaString();
    var alphaNumeric = GetRandomAlphaNumericString();
    var hostName = GetRandomHostname();
    var data = GetRandomBytes();
    var fileName = GetRandomFileName();
    var wordsInASentence = GetRandomWords();
    var versionObject = GetRandomVersion();
    var versionString = GetRandomVersionString();
    var enumValue = GetRandomEnum<SomeEnum>();
}
```

All of the above have optional parameters to influence data size (string length, how many bytes, min / max value, etc).

Naturally, the next step would be to be able to generate random _anythings_, eg it would be nice to be able to do:
```csharp
public class Person
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
  public bool IsActive { get; set; }
}

[Test]
public void ShouldGetSomeRandomValues()
{
  var person = GetRandom<Person>();
}
```

_and you can_, but let's take a quick diversion onto the other topic I brought up:

## Builders

The builder pattern is an expressive, fluent pattern for producing a complex object, and can often be seen as something like:

```csharp
[Test]
public void MakeAnAuthorWithABuilder()
{
  var person = PersonBuilder.Create()
    .WithId(42)
    .WithName("Douglas Adams")
    .WithDateOfBirth(new DateTime(1952, 3, 11))
    .WithIsActive(false) // sadly, not any more )':
    .Build();
}

```

And _one way_ to implement that builder might be:

```csharp
public class PersonBuilder
{
  public static PersonBuilder Create()
  {
    return new PersonBuilder();
  }

  private readonly List<Action<Person>> _propSetters
    = new List<Action<Person>>();

  public PersonBuilder WithProp(Action<Person> propSetter)
  {
    _propSetters.Add(propSetter);
    return this;
  }

  public PersonBuilder WithId(int id)
  {
    return WithProp(o => o.Id = id);
  }

  public PersonBuilder WithName(string name)
  {
    return WithProp(o => o.Name = name);
  }

  public PersonBuilder WithDateOfBirth(DateTime dob)
  {
    return WithProp(o => o.DateOfBirth = dob)
  }

  public PersonBuilder WithIsActive(bool isActive)
  {
    return WithProp(o => o.IsActive = isActive);
  }

  public Person Build()
  {
    var result = new Person();
    foreach (var propSetter in _propSetters)
    {
      propSetter(result);
    }
    return result;
  }
}
```

_(I prefer this kind of "mutator builder" over storing state within
a builder and applying at build time as I've found it to resist
accidental temporal couplings which can lead to unexpected results)_

This seems, of course, not that different from perhaps just using an object initializer:

```csharp
[Test]
public void MakeAnAuthorManually()
{
  var person = new Person()
  {
    Id = 42,
    Name = "Douglas Adams",
    DateOfBirth = new DateTime(1952, 3, 11),
    IsActive = false
  };
}
```

And someone had to write out the builder class. But the sense
of wasted effort is mainly
because of the nature of the object being built: it's a very simple
POCO. The "mutator" builder may seem like an over-engineered beast too,
but it also saves on having to create storage for values to apply
to the built items (iow, you don't need a field for every property
you wish to set).

However, if there were lots of times you needed a Douglas Adams in your test code, you might
refactor out a method which incorporates the whole lot, so you could rather do:

```csharp
[Test]
public void MakeAnAuthorWithABuilder()
{
  var person = PersonBuilder.Create()
    .AsDouglasAdams()
    .Build();
}

public class PersonBuilder
{
  // .. assuming that the previous methods exist:
  public PersonBuilder AsDouglasAdams()
  {
    return WithId(42)
             .WithName("Douglas Adams")
             .WithDateOfBirth(new DateTime(1952, 3, 11))
             .WithIsActive(false);
  }
}
```

In the case above, it might seem minor, but the noise in the test
has been reduced, making it easier to grok as the reader.

## Builders and randomness

In the scope of acquiring random POCOs, one might have a builder
like so:

```csharp
[Test]
public void SomeTest()
{
  var person = PersonBuilder.Create()
    .WithRandomProps()
    .Build();
}

public class PersonBuilder
{
  // .. imagine the existing builder code here
  public PersonBuilder WithRandomProps()
  {
    return WithName(GetRandomString())
            .WithId(GetRandomInt())
            .WithDateOfBirth(GetRandomDate())
            .WithIsActive(GetRandomBoolean());
  }
}
```

This becomes especially useful when there's only one
property we really care about on the user, eg:

```csharp
[Test]
public void Action_WhenUserInactive_ShouldThrow()
{
  // Arrange
  var person = PersonBuilder.Create()
                .WithRandomProps()
                .WithIsActive(false)
                .Build();
  var sut = Create();
  // Assert
  Expect(() => sut.Action(person))
    .To.Throw<InactiveUserException>();
}
```

In the test above, we want to pass in a "fully-formed"
user, with only one constraint: that user should be
inactive. We could also:
- simply create a new blank person and set `IsActive` false
  - but this may trigger other guard clauses, for instance
    that a person should have a non-zero `Id` or should have
    a `Name`
- create a person object and set all the properties within
  the test
  - but this potentially confuses the reader: there's more
    information available than is necessary. Again, this is
    a simple object, but imagine a more complex object with,
    say, 20 properties of which 10 are required to be not
    default values (especially not `null`) for other bits
    of code which the object is passed through.

Also, with our builder, we can ensure that the created
person with random properties has all _valid_ properties,
so that passing a randomized person into arbitrary blocks
of code won't cause issues. This becomes even more important
when the primary subject in a test isn't the _person_ we just
created -- perhaps we just need a `Person` object for logging,
or to complete the validity of the request context. We don't
need to add the noise of creating a `Person` and setting
all properties to valid values for a test where we just
need any `Person` going along for the ride and, eg being logged.

When the test is around a concept
like "When any person is given to the system under test, then ...",
I find that random inputs have three benefits:
1. Less for the reader of the test to read
2. When there are _no_ properties explicitly set, informs the reader
   that the actual values _don't really matter for that test, as
   long as there's a valid user_
3. When properties _are_ explicitly set, it draws attention to
   those properties as being significant for the current test
4. I find that sometimes a test will flop because a random value
   provided to it causes something to fail. A lot of the time,
   the failure is legitimate, and I can update my builder to
   constrain random generation to be within valid value ranges.
   But _sometimes_ that failure points to another issue, so I
   get the benefit of a fuzzer running on my tests.

## Where does PeanutButter fit into this discussion?

`PeanutButter.RandomGenerators` exports the base class
`GenericBuilder` which:
- provides the static "quick helper" methods:
  - `Create`
  - `BuildRandom`
  - `BuildDefault`
- provides a `WithRandomProps` method on the builder
  instance which automatically fills properties
  based on their type, and can do so down through
  parent-child relationships (ie, fill in complex
  child objects and their properties, up to 15 levels
  deep, by default)
- provides the `Build` method, so you don't have to
- allows overriding the `ConstructEntity` method, so
  that if your entity requires specific constructor
  arguments, you can handle that yourself
- does not surface exceptions if property sets fail
  - so you can use `WithRandomProps` and any property
    which doesn't appreciate the random value thrown at
    it will simply appear to remain unset, and you can
    deal with that in your own builder code
- allows overriding `WithRandomProps` so you can tailor
  the random value generation to fit within valid data
  ranges

Let's look at some code. A `GenericBuilder` needs to know
two things:
1. The type of the builder which is inheriting from it,
   so that the fluent syntax works
2. The type of the entity you wish to build

```csharp
public class PersonBuilder:
  GenericBuilder<PersonBuilder, Person>
{
}
```

The code above is enough to already be able to generate
a random `Person` with:

```csharp
[Test]
public void MakePerson()
{
  var person1 = PersonBuilder.Create()
                  .WithRandomProps()
                  .Build();
  // and if that's all you needed, there's
  //  a shorthand static method:
  var person2 = PersonBuilder.BuildRandom();
}
```

You can, of course, override `WithRandomProps` to
make random `Person` instances suit your needs; for
example, we may expect that a `Person` object should
have a non-zero `Id`:

```csharp
public class PersonBuilder:
  GenericBuilder<PersonBuilder, Person>
{
  public override PersonBuilder WithRandomProps()
  {
    // start with the built-in random behavior
    return base.WithRandomProps()
    // modify to suit our needs
            .WithValidId();
  }

  public PersonBuilder WithValidId()
  {
    // WithProp is provided by GenericBuilder
    return WithProp(o => o.Id = GetRandomInt(1, 100));
  }
}
```

And now, in the test above, `person1` and `person2`
will always have an `Id` in the range 1 to 100,
inclusive.

Great, you can use these builders, but I promised
shorthand too: `GetRandom<Person>()`. So here it is:
`PeanutButter.RandomValueGen.GetRandom<T>()` can
make you practically anything, depending on the `T`:
- when `T` is primitive (or primitive-like, eg `Guid` or `DateTime`),
  then you get a new random value for that type out. In
  other words, `GetRandom<int>()` is equivalent to
  `GetRandomInt()`
- when `T` is an enum, you'll get a random value within
  the enum's range (equivalent to `GetRandomEnum<T>()`)
- when `T` is a class, things start getting interesting:
  1. `PeanutButter` will scan assemblies for any existing
     derivatives of `GenericBuilder` where the entity
     type is `T`. It will start in the calling assembly
     and sweep outward to all loaded assemblies. The first
     found implementation "wins" and is used to generate
     a random `T`. This means that if you have implemented
     custom logic for `WithRandomProps`, _your generated
     `T` has run through your logic_, and has the shape
     that _you've defined_
  2. If no existing builder is found, one is _generated
     for you_, on the fly, in memory, and your `T` is built
     with that
  3. Any builder found or generated in the steps above
     is cached for subsequent calls to `GetRandom<T>`

In other words, the test above could simply do:
```csharp
[Test]
public void MakePerson()
{
  var person = GetRandom<Person>();
}
```
And that `Person` would be guaranteed to have an `Id`
in the range 1 to 100, inclusive.

## Declarative vs Imperative

Often, I find that declarative code is easier to grok
(and write) than imperative code. .NET has attributes,
so that might be a nice way to accomplish some of the
simpler overrides I've often found necessary with builders.

We can decorate our builders with these attributes to guide
random generation instead of overriding `WithRandomProps`,
or _in addition to_ overriding `WithRandomProps` (bearing
in mind that the call into `base.WithRandomProps` will
invoke the declarative code).

For example, we can do:
```csharp
[RequireUniqueId]
public class PersonBuilder:
  GenericBuilder<PersonBuilder, Person>
{
}
```

And each `Person` generated by `GetRandom<Person>()` would have
an unique `Id`. The range for possible ids is extended as more
`Person` objects are created, so you'll start with lower-value
`Id`s and increase from there, instead of starting with really
large values. Other attributes already included are:
- `RequireNonZero("PropertyName")`
- `RequireNonZeroId`
- `RequireUnique("PropertyName")`

And an abstract attribute, `RandomizerAttribute` is provided so you
can create your own. You simply implement `SetRandomValue`. See
the other attributes for examples (eg [RequireNonZero](https://github.com/fluffynuts/PeanutButter/blob/master/source/TestUtils/PeanutButter.RandomGenerators/RequireNonZero.cs))

## Wrapping up

As always, commentary and PR activity is welcome. The declarative
randomizer syntax is still quite young, so may be a little volatile,
but I think it's going to add readability value, not to mention
saving time when writing tests.
